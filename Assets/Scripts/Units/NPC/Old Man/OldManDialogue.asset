  - "Greetings knight, you look like you aren't from around. Or at least not for
    a long time...\r"
  - Well, this here is Commander Bahram's Fortress, which acts as the only boundary
    between The Kingdom and the deep woods.
  - I left an item of mine here but it seems they are now under new management and
    don't seem to recognize me anymore.
  - Do you think a knight such as yourself could persuade a fellow man-at-arms to
    let you go and retrieve it for me?
  - "Great! I Thank You! I was worried that bell was a malfunction in my limbic system,
    but it appears it was an omen of my good fortune!\r"
